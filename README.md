Course Description: 
Teaches how to deploy scalable infrastructure in the cloud, including how to build, test, and deploy Docker containers; Dockerize network services; and integrate containers with storage, databases, DNS, auto-scaling, and load balancers. Students will build fault-tolerant applications using a leading cloud provider (e.g. Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform). Prepares students for associate-level certifications such as AWS Certified Solutions Architect, AWS SysOps Administrator, and Microsoft Azure Administrator AZ-103. May be provided in a distance-learning format.
